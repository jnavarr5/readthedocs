Licensing the Genome Browser or Blat
------------------------------------

Do I need a license to install the Genome Browser or its databases on my own machine?
                                                                                     

A license is required for local installation of the Genome Browser web
interface or the Blat and gfServer command-line alignment tool or
webBlat interface. No license is needed for a local installation by
academic or nonprofit institution and for personal use. The images
produced by the Genome Browser and the raw data displayed by the Genome
Browser are freely available for both public and commercial use with a
few exceptions. Check the README.txt file in the assembly download
directory to view the use restrictions specific to that release. All
assemblies are available for free, and only some recommend citation of a
publication. Some human genome annotation tracks cannot be distributed
by UCSC. For details on all licensing questions see `licensing
page <../license/>`__.

Downloading the Genome Browser source
-------------------------------------

Where can I download the source code and executables for the Genome Browser?
                                                                            

The Genome Browser source code and executables are freely available for
academic, nonprofit, and personal use. The command line tools and most
of the library code is under an MIT open source license. See `Licensing
the Genome Browser or Blat <#license1>`__ for commercial licensing
requirements of certain parts of our source code. The latest version of
the source code may be downloaded
`here <http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/admin/jksrc.zip>`__.

See `Downloading Blat source and documentation <FAQblat.html#blat3>`__
for information on Blat downloads.

Mirroring the Genome Browser
----------------------------

Our academic institution would like to install and run the Genome Browser and its databases on our local server. How do we do this? Is there a procedure for updating the data when new tables and assemblies are released?
                                                                                                                                                                                                                           

Non-commercial organizations are welcome to become a Genome Browser
mirror site. A license is required for commercial local installation
(mirroring) of the Genome Browser. For detailed procedures on creating a
full or partial mirror browser, see the `mirror site procedures
page <../goldenPath/help/mirror.html>`__.

Setting up a mirror with a customized data set
----------------------------------------------

Is it possible to set up a local version of the Genome Browser that uses my own database rather than UCSC's?
                                                                                                            

The default Genome Browser installation described on the `mirror
page <../goldenPath/help/mirror.html>`__ includes all the databases and
annotation tracks found on the UCSC Genome Browser website. It is
possible to download a smaller data set to conserve space on your
server. Or, if you prefer, you can load your local version of the Genome
Browser with your own data rather than using the data supplied by UCSC.
Instructions for `building your own genome
database <http://genomewiki.ucsc.edu/index.php/Building_a_new_genome_database>`__
are located on our wiki site.

Minimum system requirements for a mirror
----------------------------------------

Are there any minimum system requirements for setting up my own mirror?
                                                                       

There are a number of minimum software and hardware requirements that
must be considered before trying to set up your own mirror. These
requirements are described in detail in the `Manual mirror installation
manual <https://genome.ucsc.edu/goldenpath/help/mirrorManual.html#hardware-and-disk-space-requirements>`__.
