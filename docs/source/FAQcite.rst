Citing the Genome Browser in publications
-----------------------------------------

How do I cite the UCSC browser in a journal publication?
                                                        

The `Citing the Genome Browser <../cite.html>`__ web page contains
detailed information on citing Genome Browser data and annotations,
screen shots, and Genome Bioinformatics group publications.

Downloading a browser screen shot
---------------------------------

How can I take a screen shot of a Genome Browser track display for publication?
                                                                               

To print or save a Genome Browser tracks image to a file, click the
"PDF/PS" link from the "View" menu of the blue navigation bar at the top
of the tracks page, then choose your preferred format. This will save a
copy of the currently displayed annotation tracks image to a file that
can be printed or edited. Images saved in PostScript format can be
printed at high resolution and edited by drawing programs such as Adobe
Illustrator. This is particularly useful for generating figures intended
for publication. Images saved in PDF format may be viewed by Adobe
Acrobat Reader.
